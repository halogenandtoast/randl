# What is this


I occasionally play board games online and have to decide on who plays which side.
In order to help with this I've decided to write a simple program that does the
following:

1) Shuffle a list of names
2) Shuffle a list of factions
3) Zip the shuffled lists together
4) Print them

This repository is a collection of programs that do this in different languages

To run each example you should cd into the appropriate directory and run `make run`
